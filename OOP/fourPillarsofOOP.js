  01.Abstraction
  02.Encapsulation
  03.Inheritance
  04.Polymorphism

Abstraction: It is basic first principle of object oriented programming(OOP) refers to the act of hiding the complexities of the values, methods in a class and object and shows the simple use of it.

Encapsulation: It is basic second principle of object oriented programming(OOP) is the process of binding all the data into single object or class and hides the internal excessories of data.
